## Basic Overview of Project
The day planner is a lightweight javascript program that allows a user to plan their day. The application will accept and save inputs for each one hour time block, retaining them even after the browser is closed so suers can return to the page later and not lose any information. The application makes use of moment.js t oget the current time, and style each time row according to if its in the past, is the current time, or is in the future.
